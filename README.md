# Converter
A Small Program converting CSV to Xml and Json.

In project I added two sample csv files. One is pure csv and the other is txt file that has a csv structure.
As I have written in help section all files must have header. The split of line is made with regular expression 
that also counts the space as sign. So if elements are separated like that "Jon, Doe, 1998" remeber to write 
separator like that ", ". I also added an xml and Json file to show how it should look like.
